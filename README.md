# ADJUST_FILE_GENERATOR

This project have two main objetives. First of all it's a personal way to study GIT and improve myself. The second objective is Create a .txt file in a certain format, doing some validations in data that are insert by the user.

Some validations on date format, CNPJ (Companys Identifier in Brasil), inserted value  and geral format of the outing file.

I'm shure that have more best ways to do that but that one i made by myself :).
